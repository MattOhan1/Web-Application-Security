      <h2>1. 🏦 Equifax Breach (2017)</h2>
      <p>
        In 2017, Equifax suffered a data breach affecting over 140 million people. Attackers exploited a known vulnerability in the Apache Struts web framework that had not been patched.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Why it happened:</strong> Failure to update and patch vulnerable software.<br>
        <strong>What was exposed:</strong> Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and more.<br>
        <strong>How it could’ve been prevented:</strong> Regular software updates and vulnerability scanning.
      </p>

      <h2>2. 📧 Yahoo Data Breach (2013–2014)</h2>
      <p>
        Yahoo disclosed that 3 billion user accounts were compromised in two separate breaches. Attackers used forged cookies and gained access to user data including names, emails, and hashed passwords.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Why it happened:</strong> Weak internal controls and poor password hashing practices.<br>
        <strong>What was exposed:</strong> Names, emails, phone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords.<br>
        <strong>How it could’ve been prevented:</strong> Stronger encryption, better monitoring, and response systems.
